          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Born in São Paulo, Brazil, practice music since I was 11 years old,
          love to play guitar and sing, listen a lot of music genres, look at
          the sky and the nature when I need to relax. I don&apos;t forget to
          record a photo of every moment.

          My Journey
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. I worked as a
          full-stack developer for 9 months at Kultech, playing a key role in
          various technological solutions, including websites, APIs, and the
          development of desktop and mobile applications. I also have experience
          in data analysis, having worked at the Brazilian bank Itaú Unibanco
          for 1 year and 7 months. There, I developed reports and dashboards,
          and worked on the development of ETLs. However, I found my passion in
          the development area, where I can create solutions that help people in
          their daily lives. I am currently offering my services as a freelancer
          for those who need a website or a system for their business.
